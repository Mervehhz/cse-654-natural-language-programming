First of all, the most important quality that a friend should have is being 
faithful. It is very important to have this feature because if you find yourself 
in a terrible situation with no way out, a faithful friend will be one of the 
first people in your life to offer their supportIn addition, the other significant quality is trustworthy. Good friends 
are those that you can trust with your deepest and secrets. They will keep 
your private information safe. Furthermore, they won’t judge you for it.  
Friendship cannot survive without relianceFinally, the last essential quality is a positive nature. A positive friend 
helps us to keep up with life and never give up. When you are having a bad 
day, even one of the worst days of your life, your best friend is there for you 
to complain to and will likely cheer you right back upTo sum up, loyalty, trustworthy and a positive nature are the most important 
features for an ideal friend. Therefore, I recommend you to be sure that 
your friends have those qualities to have a comradeship forever.

Human rights are the rights and freedoms that we all have. Although human 
rights violations exist in every part of the world, in the past 20 years, there 
has been fundamental progress in the advancement of human rightsThe UK has some of the strictest animal 
research regulations in the world. Research on 
great apes (orangutans, gorillas, chimpanzees 
and bonobos) and animal testing for cosmetics 
or their ingredients was banned. It is illegal to 
use an animal if there is an alternative non-animal method available, and the 
expected benefits accrued from the research must outweigh any potential 
animal sufferingTurkey has introduced new laws to protect 
disadvantaged people’s rights in the last 
couple of decades and reflections of these 
laws can be seen in everyday life. There 
are sections for the bedfast people in the 
hospitals. The health visitors go to these 
people’s houses and examine them. The conditions of the orphanages are also 
improved and the government has been turning the orphanages to the flats 
where the orphan children live in good conditions under the protection of 
caretakers. 
Many local and global organisations work to stop child 
labour. Their ultimate goal is to stop child trafficking and 
exploitation entirely. They focus on awareness-raising, 
education, capacity building, assisting private entities 
in developing their labour programs, as well as working 
with communities. With the help of the organisations 
the number of child labour in the world is decreasing 
gradually.

Most children help with the work in their homes. They do things like cleaning, 
helping with the housework, doing the shopping or feeding the pet. Children 
have to do their share of the work in order to learn useful life skills. 
However, there is a big difference between house duties and forcing the 
children to work in hazardous conditions, such as working in mines, factories 
or in agriculture. Millions of children aged 5 -14 are engaged in child labour. 
Children do this work because their families are very poor and depend on the 
money the child earns. One of the most important human rights is children’s 
right. Every child has a right to have education, to have time for playing and 
to be saved and to be looked after. Child labour causes many problems. First, 
children work long and hard hours for very little pay. Because they do not 
go to school, they are often illiterate, which means they can’t get a good job 
and face a life of poverty. This is not only bad for them, but also for the 
development of the countries. Every country should take precautions to stop 
child labour1. Why is it important for children to share the work at home?
