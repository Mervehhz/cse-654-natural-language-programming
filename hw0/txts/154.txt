Technology is very important because it is almost in every part of our lives and like 
everything, it      has advantages and disadvantages. To understand technology, one 
must know what it provides in terms of advantages, but also disadvantages2…
Technology has made life better in modern society today so much that people rely on 
it more than humans at times. At the medical level, technology can help treat more 
sick people and consequently save many lives and combat very harmful viruses and 
bacteria. Another positive aspect is in the field of agriculture. With the introduction 
of the agricultural equipment such as tractor, human-beings are able to increase 
food output. Also, traveling was time consuming since animals were being used as 
vehicles. Now, we have planes, trains and many others which have made our lives 
faster and easier3…
On the other hand, the evolution of modern technology has disadvantages. For 
example, many of us are addicted to various gadgets around us such as remote 
controls, mobile phones and computers. All these things make us lazy. Another 
disadvantage is about privacy. If you open up a browser or if you use a smart phone, 
your phone numbers and even your home address are no longer private. Anyone can 
access your personal information by visiting relevant websites or by using tracking 
software! Also, with the introduction of social media and smartphones, more and 
more people prefer to interact online rather than meeting their friends and family. 
This leads to loneliness and stress4… 
In conclusion, everything that we use in life good or bad upon the use. It contributed 
immensely to the overall experience of humankind; to our material comfort and wellbein and to our greater understanding of the world we live in. However, we must 
balance the use of technology with the possibility we may be crushed by these new 
ways of doing thingsParagrap1. Some people get addicted to Internet activities anwaste time and energy3. Too much use of technology has caused pollution4.

A web page is a document commonly written in HTML that is accessible through the 
Internet or other networks using an Internet browser. A web page is accessed by 
entering a URL address and may contain text, graphics, and hyperlinks to other web 
pages and files. Below is an analysis of each of the major elements of an Internet

The girls in the secondary schools in Europe all have the same access to 
computers as boys. But some researchers say, by the time they get to the 
high school, they are victims of what the researchers call a major new 
gender gap in technologyMost of the psychologists say, “Girls are not as comfortable as the boys 
with the computer. (1) They use it more for word processing rather 
than for problem solving, rather than to discover new ways in which to 
understand information.”
After re-examining many studies, researchers found that girls 
make up only a small percentage of students in computer science classes. 
Girls consistently rate themselves significantly lower than boys in their 
ability and confidence in using computers. And (2) they use computers 
less often than boys outside the classroom. 
Five years ago, the technology company Cloud Icon noticed that girls’ 
computer usage was falling behind boys. Andre Howard form Cloud Icon 
Technologies says, “The number one reason girls told (3) me they don’t 
like computer games is not because they’re too violent, or too competitive. 
Girls just said (4) they’re incredibly boring. What we definitely found 
from girls is there is no intrinsic reason why they wouldn’t want to play on 
a computer; it was just a content thing.”
The participants of the study say it all boils down to this, the technology 
gender gap that separates the girls from the boys must be closed if 
women are to compete effectively with men in the 21st century   THEME 4    TECHNOLOG1.

Dear Mandy,
Thank you for your letter. It’s always a pleasure to receive your lettersYou asked me how I spent the summer. You know I always go to the seaside 
with my family for holiday. But this year, some of my friends and I decided to 
go to a youth camp. But everything went bad. First, I caught a cold and I was 
sick for two weeks. Because of this, I could not go to the camp and I spent a 
month in a stuffy city. I had really hard times. I felt unhappy. 
Then the weather turned bad and again I had to stay at home. It was not the 
best summer of my life. If only I had gone to the seaside with my family as 
usual. 
Well, I’ve got to finish. It is now 11:30 p.m. it’s time to sleep. 
Take care of yourself,
CindDear Diary, 
       6th May I woke up very late today. When I looked at the clock I said “Oh, I am 
going to be late for the Yoga class and my teacher is going to punish me 
for this”. It wasn’t the first time I had been late for the class and my 
teacher would get angry with for the same reason: coming late to the 
class. Anyway, I brushed my teeth and put on my clothes immediately and 
went to catch my bus. As soon as I got there I was shocked to see that 
the bus had already left taking all the passengers from the bus stop. I 
sat on the bench and I was very worried. I wish I had woken up earlier. 
I had been waiting there for the next bus for an hour, but there was 
no sign of it. I felt so frustrated and disappointed, and I didn’t know 
what to do. Just then, a car stopped near me and my friend Charlie 
called my name. I was very excited to see him, because we hadn’t seen 
each other for a long time. He asked me “What are you doing here by 
yourself?” I told him the whole story and requested that he gave me a 
ride to the Yoga school. He smiled and said he would be very happy to 
do that. He drove as fast as he could and we finally reached to the 
school. I handed over my business card to him, which had my address and 
telephone number on it. He again smiled and waved his hand to say 
goodbyeLuc   THEME 5    MANNERS

Having good manners is important to everyone especially in today’s society. 
Good manners are a very valuable possession for developing social 
relations, and they help a person to win friends. The social standing 
of a man is judged by the manners be possesses. Polished and polite 
manners create a healthy impactGood manners go a long way in making a person cultured and civilized. A 
man without good manners remains a savage. Normally good manners are 
inherited from parents. But these can also be learnt from others. It is, 
therefore, essential that all children are taught good manners form the 
childhood itselfA well-mannered person is always the centre of attraction. He is loved 
and respected by all. Good manners bring joy and success in his life. We 
should acquire good manners and enrich our personalityAnitAs we were growing up, the people around us encouraged us to have good 
manners. Good manners are described as being polite and respectful 
towards others. Good manners teach us to be polite and have good social 
behaviours towards people living around us. 
But nowadays, good manners don’t make people achieve their goals and 
therefore, not necessary while others still maintain that it is important. 
In today’s modern world, good manners are used as a tool for dishonesty. 
People behave politely to achieve what they want. After getting what they 
want, they go back to their bad behaviours. Therefore, good manners 
serve no purpose and make no sense in the current worldMartiThe main conclusion of the Anita’s text is______Good manners are important to everybody in today’s worldGood manners teach how to show consideration to othersThe main conclusion of the Martin’s text is_______Good manners make an individual have an advantage in a job interviewGood manners are not needed in the present world   THEME 5    MANNERS
