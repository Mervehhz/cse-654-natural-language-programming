Paragraph 2: Topic sentence: First of all, during my grandparents’ time, people 
used to work much harder because they didn’t have such tools which made their 
work easier 
Supporting sentence(s): They had to do all the errands by hand         Supporting example(s): For example; A couple decades ago, people used to wash 
their clothes in  river as they didn’t have running water in many houses or people 
used to use candles at home as there was no electricity at home. 
 
Paragraph 3: Topic sentence: People weren’t able to travel long distances in a short 
period of time as the planes were used to be rare and very expensive 
Supporting sentence(s): Most of the people didn’t know neither fast cars nor 
planes. Trips were  long, uncomfortable and dangerous 
Supporting example(s): For example; It used to take a couple of days or weeks to 
go to a place  where we can go in a few hours today and they had to travel along 
the deserted and dangerous roads 
Paragraph 4: Topic sentence: Another thing is that the entertainment and 
communication choices used to be  very limited 
Supporting sentence(s): They could at best listen to the radio, records or the lucky 
ones could watch black-and-white movie for pleasure. They used to write letters 
or send telegrams to communicate. There weren’t such devices that we use today 
Supporting example(s): For instance; When my grandparents were young, there 
were no mobile phones. They even had to wait for hours to make an ordinary 
phone call17.  Students’ own answer18. Suggested answer:
