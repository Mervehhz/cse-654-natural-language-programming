ENGLISH - THEME Tapescript 3.  Listen and choose the best title for the storyOnce upon a time, a farmer had a hen that laid a golden egg every day. The egg provided 
enough money for the farmer and his wife for their day-to-day needs. The farmer and 
his wife were happy for a long time. But one day, the farmer got an idea and thought, 
“Why should I take just one egg a day? Why can’t I take all of them at once and make 
a lot of money?”
The foolish farmer’s wife also agreed and decided to cut the hen’s stomach for the eggs. 
As soon as they killed the bird and opened the hen’s stomach, to find nothing but guts 
and blood. The farmer, realizing his foolish mistake, cries over the lost resource!
