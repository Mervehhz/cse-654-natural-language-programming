injures people and damage properties. These disasters can occur anywhere on earth. There 
are different kinds of natural events; avalanche, flood, volcano, earthquake, hurricane, tornado, 
tsunami, drought are some of them. For example; an 1) ...................... is a sudden shaking of 
the earth’s surface that often causes a lot of damage. Earthquakes are usually caused when 
rock underground suddenly breaks along a fault. This sudden release of energy causes the 
seismic waves that make the ground shake. The cracks along the fault lines are risky and they 
can cause harmful damages on the surface. A 2) ................. is an extremely violent storm and 
it spins very quickly and causes a lot of damage. They are known to be the most powerful and 
destructive natural event. They are very common, especially in the USA. Like all natural disasters 
such as hurricanes, floods, earthquakes and others, they always end up with massive 
destruction. A 3) .....................occurs when hot mixture of gasses, lava, ashes are thrown out of 
volcano. A volcano looks like a mountain and especially these eruptions occur in mountainous 
lands. It can also occur in a water. If the eruptions occur close to human settlements, it may 
destroy lives or properties. A 4) ................. is a natural event or occurrence where a piece of 
land suddenly gets submerged under water. Floods can occur suddenly and recede 
quickly. When it happens in an area that people live, the huge amount of water carries along
