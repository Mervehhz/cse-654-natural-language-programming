had graduated from high school, she entered the university. By the time she went on 
to study at Stanford University, she had become a highly ranked tennis player. In 1973,

Science’ degree at Stanford. 
  In 1977, in response to a newspaper advertisement, Ride applied for NASA’s space 
program. The next year she became one of the 35 applicants selected for the program 
out of the 8000 who had applied. Sally Ride began astronaut training along with other 
ENGLISH - women chosen in August 1978. During training, the astronauts went through flight 
training, water survival, weightlessness, and training in navigation and communications. 
After she had completed her training, she became the first American woman in space 
as a crew member on the space shuttle Challenger 7 in 1983.It was a six-day mission. 
The next year she went on another space flight, again on the ‘Challenger’ space shuttle. 
She was one of a crew of seven, along with another female astronaut. However, tragedy 
struck in 1986 when the tenth shuttle mission of the Challenger exploded moments
