Dr. Perkins: Good morning Mrs. Flash. Please have

Dr. Perkins: Alright Martha.

Dr. Perkins: 3) ____________________________________________ 
Martha: I feel exhausted and I can’t concentrate. I have been feeling miserable 
for the last couple of days. I’m not enthusiastic to begin my day. I even don’t 
want to go out with my friends. I really feel depressedDr. Perkins: 4) ___________________________________________ 
Martha: I work as an executive assistant so I am always under stress. I have to 
arrange many things and they all must be on time and in order so I always feel 
nervous. I have also poor concentration at work these days so it stresses me more. 
Dr. Perkins: Is it possible that your sleeping problems are because of your work 
stress. You have been under stress for a long time. 5) __________________ 
_________________________________________________Martha: It’s impossible for me to take even a day off for the next two months. 
Dr. Perkins: Then, I suggest that you be active. Even moderate exercise 
releases chemicals in your brain that you will feel relieved. It can help you sleep 
better. My other suggestion is to keep in touch with your friends. When you feel 
bad, being with a friend can lighten your burden and begin a process of ending 
your unhappiness. You may also make healthy choices about your diet. That can 
make you feel emotionally stronger. A good diet helps your brain and body work 
efficiently, tooMartha: Thank you very much for your suggestions. I’ll follow them immediately THEME 5    PSYCHOLOG10. Imagine that you are Dr Perkins.

1. ____________________________________Positive and negative emotions is a natural part of being human anthey help us to take action, to survive, strike and avoid danger, to makdecisions, to understand others and to be understood by the othersNegative emotions alert us to threats or challenges that we need tdeal with. For example; when we perceive someone’s facial expression treflect fear, we tend to look out for dangerous stimuli in the environmentLikewise, we feel relaxed and safe when sensing happiness in others2. ____________________________________Emotions have a certain power over our thoughts. Emotions that we feeeach day can compel us to take action and influence the decisions wmake about our lives, both large and small. They can also motivate us ttake action. For instance; when we have an important exam, we may feeanxiety about whether we will perform well or not. Because of thesemotional responses, we might be more likely to study3. ____________________________________It is sure that positive emotions make us feel good but what else they dfor us? Studies show that people do their best when they have positivemotions. Positive emotions not only balance out our negative emotionbut also, they affect our brain to increase our awareness, creativitand memory. When we feel more positive emotions than negative ones,
difficult situations are easier to be handleda. Do emotions influence our thinking?

Jason: It’ll be a mix. There is nothing special in my mindWalter: I can suggest you a few classics of metal musicJason: No, it’s not really my thing. I believe that metal music makes people aggressiveWalter: I completely disagree with you. I think it depresses stressJason: Why do you think so?
Walter: According to some researches, metal music is believed to help cope with thfeelings of depression or stress. The reason is mainly due to the loud growls and screamas well as the tempo and drumbeats of the music. In my opinion, listening to heavy metacan help people calmer, especially angry people. I love listening to itJason: I tend to agree with you but soothing music like soft rock or smooth jazz heals meI also prefer reggae and soul musicWalter: What do you think about rap and hip hop?
Jason: I don’t mind listening to them. I find them annoying, especially lyrics. They havlots of profanity. I would probably enjoy if there wasn’t so much profanity. Not only tune,
but also lyrics impact my music preferenceWalter: I agree with you in that point but I love listening to rap music because it makes mfeel like I can face any challenges that I have. Actually, tune impacts me moreJason: I’d rather listen to country music because every song depicts a story for any situatiothat life might throw at you. Country music is in my opinion the heart and soul of oucountry and no matter what mood you’re in, it can always make you feel better and neveworseWalter: How do you feel about classical music?
Jason: I love classical music. Unlike pop or rap music, classical music is more complex 
with different sections and comes up with new ideas instead of repetition. Classical music 
is great for when I need to focus, and I enjoy piano and violin duets. 
Walter: You are absolutely right. I remember that there was a study called the ‘Mozart 
Effect’ where they discovered that classical music could make a child smarter. But I think 
I like fast music more.

Human rights are the rights and freedoms that we all have. Although human rights 
violations exist in every part of the world, in the past 20 years, there has been fundamental 
progress in the advancement of human rightsThe UK has some of the strictest animal research regulations in the world. Research on great 
apes (orangutans, gorillas, chimpanzees and bonobos) and animal testing for cosmetics 
or their ingredients was banned. It is illegal to use an animal if there is an alternative 
non-animal method available, and the expected benefits accrued from the research must 
outweigh any potential animal sufferingTurkey has introduced new laws to protect disadvantaged people’s rights in the last couple 
of decades and reflections of these laws can be seen in everyday life. There are sections 
for the bedfast people in the hospitals. The health visitors go to these people’s houses and 
examine them. The conditions of the orphanages are also improved and the government 
has been turning the orphanages to the flats where the orphan children live in good 
conditions under the protection of caretakers. 
Many local and global organisations work to stop child labour. Their ultimate goal is to 
stop child trafficking and exploitation entirely. They focus on awareness-raising, education, 
capacity building, assisting private entities in developing their labour programs, as well as 
working with communities. With the help of the organisations the number of child labour 
in the world is decreasing gradually11. Students’ own answer12. Students’ own answer13. Some faculty buildings need to be repaired.
