WATER FOR ALL (WAFA) FOUNDATIOAlmost 700 million people live without clean 
water all over the world. That’s nearly 1 in 10 
people worldwide without access to life’s most 
basic human need. The majority live in isolated 
rural areas and spend many hours every day 
walking 
to 
collect 
water 
for 
their        
families. Not only does walking for water keep 
kids out of school and take up time thaparents could be using to earn money, but the water often carries diseases 
that make them sick. 
Water for All (WAFA) foundation was established in Turkey in 2005. A 
group of musicians established the foundation under the leadership of 
some politicians. The foundation is a non-profit organization bringing clean 
and safe drinking water to people in developing countries. 
Clean water can improve health, increase access to food, grow local 
economies, and help kids spend more time in school. When a community 
gets access to clean water, it can change just about everythingDrinking water crisis is a huge problem, but it is solvable. We work with 
local experts and community members to find the best sustainable solution 
in each place where we work. And with every water point we fund, our 
partners coordinate sanitation and hygiene training and establish a local 
Drinking Water Group to help keep water flowing for years to comeWe invite you to learn about the stories of the men, women, and children 
living without clean water, and how you can help. 
Then, join us and make an impact. For 50 TL, you can bring clean drinking 
water for one person. Join our weekly giving community, The Mountain, and 
give the gift of clean water all year round   THEME 1   FAVOR15. Match the words taken from the text in activity 14 to their definitions(14. çalışmadaki okuma parçasından alınan kelimeleri tanımlarıyla eşleştiriniz.)

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Nearly a week after Celine Redd’s rare triple organ 
transplant, she has been taken off sedation at 
Children’s Hospital. The operation was successful. 
Celine’s mother, Nancy Redd, is thrilled that Celine 
is alert and holding her hand for the first time 
after the surgery. Family and friends are happy to 
see Celine’s eyes once againNine-year-old Celine has Hirschsprung’s disease, 
which occurs when nerve cells are missing in the 
muscle of the colon. While another child was waiting for an organ transplant, 
Celine’s condition became worse. Her liver was failing, and she’d already 
been admitted to the hospital because of bleedingCeline’s family was surprised when doctors informed them that a potential 
donor had been found. At 6 a.m. on Friday, September 15, Celine was rolled 
into the operating room for a transplant of her liver, small bowels and 
pancreas. During the transplant, doctors were unable to close her abdomen 
because of swelling from the new organs. Doctors were finally able to close 
it on September 21 by using a biosynthetic material to replicate the muscle 
structure of her abdomenShortly after the surgery, Nancy Redd, who has posted about Celine’s 
surgery on social media, was shocked and excited to receive a message 
from another family. After a few questions, “I knew 100%” it was the 
family of the donor, she saidThe family of the donor read the story about Celine’s multi-organ transplant 
on social media and reached out to Nancy Redd. The mothers are now 
friends on social media and have shared encouraging messages with each 
other.
