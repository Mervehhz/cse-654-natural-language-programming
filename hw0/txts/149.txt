ENGLISH - THEME - SPORTMany psychologists say that doing sports helps teens develop and maintain 
friendship. Especially in the team sports. But extreme sports are mostly individual 
sports and it is discussed that they are beneficial or not. Extreme athletes say that 
they love taking risks. But others say that extreme sports are too dangerous. They say 
those sports shouldn't be played. Are extreme sports too extreme?
Yes! Too Extreme! 
1. 2. Extreme sports set a bad example. Kids who see those sports on TV might want 
to try them at home. But they might not know how to play those sports safely. 
When people play extreme sports, they are no longer playing games. They're being 
irresponsibleNo! Not As It Looks!
Atatürk says that he likes sportsman who are smart, agile and also well-behaved. 
Th s is the motto for all of us. You have to be smart, agile and well-behaved if you are 
involved in extreme sports. I think people should change their point of view3. .…
4. .…
What about the thrills that come with doing extreme sports? "I like the risk." said 
a 16 year-old parkour runner. "If you didn't take risks, life would be boring."
Do you think that extreme sports are really too extreme?
a. Some rocclimbers climb 
without using 
ropes. Some bungee 
jumpers leap out of 
helicopters. Street luge 
riders race downhill 
on wheeled sleds at 
speeds of more than 
120 kilometers per 
hour. There is no good 
reason for people to 
risk their lives doing 
those things. So, I say 
yes. Extreme sports 
are really too extremec. First of all,
people can become 
seriously injured 
while doing extreme 
sports. Risking serious 
injury to play a 
sport is foolish. Take 
wingsuit flyers, for 
instance. The wingsuit 
flie s wear parachute 
equipment and dive 
off a ountain, then 
glide through the trees 
below at speeds up to 
155 miles per hour. It’s 
terrifying. 
b. Actually,
some people just 
aren't used to do the 
things that extreme 
sports athletes can 
do. Th s is the main 
problem. Whereas 
extreme sports 
have benefits that 
other sports don't 
have. Some doctors 
say that extreme 
sports can help 
young athletes build 
courage and provide 
self-relianced. Firstly, I casay that there is a big 
misunderstanding. 
Extreme sports have 
picked up a bad 
name. Every sport 
comes with the risk 
of injury. Injuries in 
regular sports can 
be far worse than 
those that happen 
in extreme sports. 
We’ve seen people 
killed in boxing 
rings and deaths 
during football 
matches16. Read the interview in activity 12 and complete the answers. (12. çalışmadakröportajı okuyunuz ve cevapları tamamlayınız.)

STORY OF KEANU REEVEKeanu Reeves was born in 1964 in Beirut, Lebanon 
and grew up in the Canadian city of Toronto. There, in 
the town theatre, he gathered his first acting experiences, 
especially in Shakespeare plays. His big screen career 
started in the 80s with ground-breaking projects such as 
“River’s Edge”, 1986, “Dangerous Liaisons”, 1988, “Aunt 
Julia & The Scriptwriter”, 1990, “Point Break”, 1991Over the years, there's a lot that's been written at 
length about Keanu Reeves. But what you may not know 
is how incredibly tragic the actor’s life has really been. 
He was abandoned by his father at the age of three. 
During his childhood, his mother moved them around a lot, causing him to attend 
multiple schools and never make lasting friendships. His education was also hindered 
by his dyslexia, a disorder which makes reading difficult because the eyes do not 
perceive letters in their correct orderHowever, he overcame these obstacles and made his way to Hollywood. There, he 
finally formed a lasting friendship with fellow actor, River Phoenix. Sadly, Phoenix 
died at the age of 23. Reeves still misses his dear friend, who he considered a brotherIn 1998, he met and fell in love with Jennifer Syme. A year later, the couple were 
expecting a daughter. Tragically, the baby was stillborn. The heartbreak eventually 
drove the pair apart and Jennifer died in a car accident shortly afterKeanu calls his younger sister, Kim, his best friend. She was diagnosed with 
leukemia and endured a long battle with the cancer before eventually beating it. Ever 
since, Reeves donates a percentage of his salary to leukemia research, including 70% of 
his paycheck from “The Matrix.”
