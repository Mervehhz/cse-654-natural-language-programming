It was early in the morning on Monday. The Central Bank had just been opened. 
There was quite a big rush of customers. Some had come to withdraw money while 
others had come to deposit. The counter clerks were busy and no one noticed the 
arrival of three robbers. They entered the bank and cut off the telephone wires and 
then, ordered the staff to raise their hands up. They took out their pistols and ordered 
the staff to march into the strong room and locked them up there. Then, the robbers 
went to the cash counter, collected all the money and then, quietly slipped out of the 
bank. A car was waiting for them and they drove away. No one knew from where they 
had come and where they were bound for. The bank suffered a great lossThe police rushed to the place as quickly as possible but they couldn’t arrive in 
time. They interrogated the people who were in the bank. They noted down the 
details. Messages were flashed in all directions to catch the robbers, who were all very 
young but seemed to be hardened criminals. The car which had been used was found 
abandoned. It was a stolen car and belonged to an industrialist of the locality.

fell asleep and we missed the bus for the 
airport. We jumped out of the bed, put our 
clothes on as fast as we could and called a 
taxi. Our flight was in 10 minutes. I was 
very worried that we couldn’t arrive in 
time. We came to the check-in  desk but there was a long   queue. When it was our 
turn, the man said that we were late. I started crying. I thought that we would stay in 
Egypt for the rest of my life. Then, I fainted. I was in the Airport Emergency Service 
when I opened my eyes. Some people who were working on the airport were looking 
after me. In the end, we bought new tickets but the flight was on the next day, so my 
family and I slept on the floor whole night. In the morning, we landed in Turkey.

  Dear Readers 
Sincerely your1……………….……,
On Friday, June 28, 2017, I went to the Rainbow Philharmonic Orchestra 
concert at the Atatürk Arena.  It was a wonderful concert. I can tell what 
changes they have made every year.  This year, they had the guitarists walk 
above the crowd on two walks suspended from the ceiling instead of lifting 
them up on a raising platform on the opposite end of the floor.  
Musically, they were wonderful as always.  However, the lady who had the 
solo in “The King of My Heart” messed up.  First off all, she wasn’t hitting the 
notes. Then, she missed an entrance. They should have chosen another singer.  
You’ve got to love the lights, lasers, and cool video screens that move around 
above the stage. But lots of electrical devices such as lights and lasers and long 
wires could have been dangerous for the audiencesThe music and the musicians were lively. They put on an excellent show. They 
played the songs from all three of their albums. But they should also have played 
some of the popular songs. It could have attracted more attentionThey ended their performance by explaining that İstanbul was the first place 
that they wanted to go on their tour. But they should change some of their vocal 
artists before they go to İstanbul 2……………...……..

APHRODISIAAphrodisias was a small ancient Greek 
Hellenistic city in the historic Caria cultural 
region of western Anatolia. It is located near 
the modern village of Geyre, about 100 km east, 
inland from the coast of the Aegean Sea, 230 
km southeast of İzmir and 55 km from Nazilli 
and 101 km from Denizli, Turkey. The name 
of the city is derived from the goddess of love, 
Aphrodite - called Venus by Romans, who has 
her famous sanctuary hereAphrodisias is one of the most impressing ancient cities of Anatolia with its wellpreserve buildings and numbers of magnificent sculptures from the Roman period. 
Being built near a marble quarry, the city was also an important center in the past with 
its famous sculpture school and for being one of the several cities that was dedicated 
to Aphrodite, the goddess of love. 
The city was named after Aphrodite in the 2nd century BC. But before being known 
as Aphrodisias, it had three previous names: Lelegon Polis, Megale Polis and Ninoe. 
The city was later renamed as Stauropolis in the Christian Era. 
Aphrodisias was also a hometown for renowned scholars and philosophers. 
The philosopher Xenocrates, who had been a student of Plato, is believed to live in 
AphrodisiasThe excavations at the city have been held 
systematically since 1961 by deceased Professor

Butterfly Valley is a large canyon that is considered to be one of the most picturesquand amazing places in Turkey. In Turkish it is called Kelebekler Vadisi and it is a prime 
example of the beautiful result of Mother Nature’s work2………………………
It is basic, in fact it is a wooden hut.  If the wooden huts are not your idea of fun, you 
can rent a tent for the night or you are even invited to sleep on the beach!
3………………………
Whether you visit Butterfly Valley just for the day or overnight the emphasis on 
“things to do” is all about keeping in touch with nature. Trekkers and hikers will have 
a field day in the canyon while photographers better free up memory space on their 
cameras. Swimmers and snorkelers will have a great time in the crystal blue water or 
you can just chill out and sunbath on the beach.

The best way is by using the official Butterfly Valley boat taxi which leaves from 
Ölüdeniz at 11.00 a.m. and 2 p.m., returning from the valley at 1 p.m. and 5 p.m. You

OLYMPOOlympos is a great destination for 
backpackers; It’s cheap, the weather 
is warm and there are many other 
backpackers. I am staying at a hostel by 
the sea. The hostel is only a 10-minute 
walk to the beach which makes it perfect 
for multiple visits a day. The staff are 
friendly and the lunch menu is full of 
really delicious options. At night, you can take a trip to the Chimaera. In the Chimaera, 
there are about a dozen flames that burn on the side of the mountain. The water in 
Olympos is the perfect temperature and calm so there are many activities available at 
the beach.Rock climbing is also a popular activity in OlymposHow to get to OlympoFrom Antalya you can get a minivan from the bus station. Mini vans run every 30 
minutes and there is no need to book in advance. You can also get a taxi from Antalya…………………………………………………………………………
