at the age of 18. She was thrilled to start her brand new life and as a 
tradition, the kitchen chores fell into the hands of Kalyani. She embraced 
it happily and went on for two months unknowing of the danger that awaited 
her. It was hardly the third month of her marriage, while she was working in 
the kitchen to light her kerosene pump stove. The stove suddenly burst into 
flames, burning everything around. As she was wearing a synthetic saree, it 
caught fire immediately. The impact threw Kalyani a few feet away. There 
was no one to help Kalyani as she was alone with the doors lockedKalyani was in a state of panic and her brain froze for a moment. She 
couldn’t make sense of the situation that just unfolded in front of her eyes. 
A moment later, she came to terms and to her luck, she got hold of a blanket 
and smothered the flames that were burning her upper body. The saree 
stuck to her skin like a jelly and while smothering she fainted in the endless 
process. Soon her neighbours broke open the house 
and doused the fire inside the kitchen. Then, Kalyani 
was rushed to a private hospital, where she spent 
three weeks in intensive care. After that, she spent 
about a month in the hospitalBy Karen Fog  THEME 2  NEWS STORIE14. Make a presentation about the news story in activity 13. Look athe tips in the box below. (Çalışma 13’deki haber hakkında bir sunuyapınız. Kutu içindeki ipuçlarına bakınız.)

very badly damaged. I was in intensive care for a week and then on the

died. That’s when it really hit me. I thought everybody had crawled out 
like me. Following this event, I was back at work by April. I have always 
been robust. Of course, I was lucky to be able to get up out of my seat.

We have good news about the twelve boys and their football coach who are 
trapped in a Thai cave. They are alive and well. The group was missing for nine 
days, but was found by rescuers yesterday. The search for the group was 
24-hour news in Thailand. It was unclear where they were or whether  they 
were still alive. The boys, aged between 11 and 16, and their 25-year-old 
coach went missing. They went into the cave in northern Thailand when it was 
dry, but there was suddenly heavy rain. This blocked the exit to the cave. 
The rain flooded it and the boys and their coach were trappedThe bad news was that the soccer team could be trapped in the cave for 
months. Rescuers had to wait until the water recedes before the team can 
get out. Another possibility was for the boys to learn to dive. If they did 
that, they could get out sooner. However, none of the boys could swim. They 
tried to put power and telephone lines in the cave. Two British rescue divers 
who found the boys said they were all happy, but very, very hungry. The 
rescuers took a video of them. A mother of one of the boys described her 
happiness. She said: “I’m so happy I can’t put it into words.”

Alternative Energy SourceWe have many reasons to use alternative energy sources. One of them is to reduce 
pollutants and greenhouse gases. Alternative or renewable energy sources help to 
reduce the amount of toxins that are a result of traditional energy use. These alternative 
energy sources help protect against the harmful by-products of energy use and help to 
preserve many of the natural resources that we currently use as energy sources.There 
are lots of alternative energy sources: wind power, solar power, geothermal power are 
some examplesWind Energy 
Wind power is the ability to capture the wind in a way to propel the blades of wind 
turbines. It’s one of the oldest forms of energy humans have used. Modern versions 
are called wind turbines. It’s a relatively inexpensive energy source, but requires careful 
planning. Wind energy does not create any harmful emissions and has far fewer impacts 
on the environment than other forms of energySolar Energy 
Solar energy is derived from an abundant resource that we see nearly every day and 
often take for granted: The sun. In fact, the earth gets far more energy from the sun in a 
single day than the entire planet uses from other sources. Solar energy can be collected 
in a variety of ways. It doesn’t create pollution or greenhouse gases and can be used to 
charge your phone or it can produce power an entire house or townGeothermal Energy 
It means “earth heat”. It comes from steam naturally made within the earth, and is 
often used to generate electricity or to heat a building. Geothermal heat pumps are 
probably the most efficient and cheapest way to heat any building. Geothermal energy is 
renewable and clean energy that comes from the earth. Geothermal power plants have 
lower emissions compared to other types of power plantsIt is clear that alternative energy systems are rapidly becoming more efficient and 
cheaper. You will need to be part of the ongoing and individual application of alternative 
energy sources so the Earth stays healthy and our resources stay renewed1. What should we do to reduce pollutants and greenhouse gases?

Environmental problems are caused by man, knowingly or unknowingly, as man 
goes about his daily activities. The problems arises as a result of the following 
problems which are: 
CLIMATE CHANGClimate scientists agree that climate change is occurring and greenhouse gas 
emissions are the main cause. Your home and transportation could be major 
sources of greenhouse gas emissions. A certified home energy audit can help 
make your home more energy efficient. If you commute via biking, walking or 
public transportation, you are doing your part to fight global warmingAIR POLLUTIOThis refers to contamination of the air such that it becomes dangerous to the 
health when it is breathed in. Air pollution and climate change are closely linked, 
as the same greenhouse gas emissions that are warming the planet are also 
creating smoggy conditions in major cities that endanger public health. Many of 
the solutions to air pollution are similar to those for climate change, though it’s 
important to either make a concerted effort to drive less, or switch to a loweremission vehicle. Switching over to green energy is also important, as that will 
cut back on fossil fuel emissionsWATER POLLUTIOThis refers to contamination of water such as the lakes and seas. Only three 
percent of the world’s water is fresh water and 1.1 billion people lack access 
to clean, safe drinking water. Some ideas to be more water efficient include 
installing an energy star-certified washer, using low-flow faucets, plugging up 
leaks, irrigating the lawn in the morning or evening when the cooler air causes 
less evaporation, taking shorter showers and not running sink water when 
brushing your teeth1. How many people can reach safe and clean drinking water all over the world?

I am a teacher at Rockhill High School and I am a resident of Middlerock 
district of our town. I’m writing to inform about the environmental problems 
of the park in our neighbourhood. 
Many people use this park in our residential area. It is also on my way to 
school as many other students. Lately I have seen litter everywhere of 
the park. It’s a sad sight for our town. Because of this reason, there is a 
terrible smell that is harmful for us in the park, too. Other problems are 
street lamps and park warden. There is not enough street lamps and there 
is no security staff. It can be dangerous for the people living around. 
To address these problems, I would suggest that the garbage should be 
collected every day to prevent the accumulation of waste and also there 
should be more street lamps and a security staff in the parkAs a municipality, you have to look into this issue to avoid these kinds of 
problems. I am sure that you will do your best to solve this problem. Thank 
you in advance for your prompt attention to this matter.

a. Technology is developing rapidlyb. There are two kinds of technologyDevelopments in the world of 3D printing 
continue to change the world. Then, they 
constantly 
bring 
innovations 
with 
their 
seemingly limitless potential. Slowly but surely, 
3D printers are getting cheaper, better, and 
drastically more accessible. However, there 
were only a few models on the market in the 
early days and most of them were clunky, 
tricky to use and very expensive, so many 
home users couldn’t buy one of them. Mine is one of the new models. It’s not as 
expensive as the old ones but it is better than them. Firstly, you don’t need a 
computer to use it. Because it has a usb port to use your flash drive directly. 
Additionally, you can use many other devices as a source such as smart 
phones, tablets and portable hard drives. The printer has an open frame design, 
making it relatively light and portable. In spite of its open frame design, it is dustproo and durable. Although all these remarkable features, it can be bought at 
reasonable price. I’m happy with its quality and features. Therefore, I strongly

the future of technology?
