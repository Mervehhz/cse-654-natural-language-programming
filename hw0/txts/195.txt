2. Match the words from the passage with the definitions. (Kelimeleri anlamlarıyleşleştiriniz.)
LET’S READ - R2.What should we do in case of an emergency? 
Everyone knows the answer, because the answer is 
easy. We should stay calm and call the emergency 
number 1-1-2.  But in some cases, we have to 
interfere the situation. So, we need to know how to 
do first aid. For instance, when someone faints, first 
of all check his or her pulse. Secondly, call 1-1-2 and 
then position the person properly and wait for the 
paramedics. When the paramedics come, tell them 
the person’s state and what you didOn the other hand, bad things can come to you. For example, if 
you got a cut in your hand or somewhere else, do you know what 
to do? First of all, you should put a piece of clean cloth on it. But 
be careful, this piece of cloth must be clean because you may get 
infected. Nobody wants to catch an infection from an open wound. 
When you stop bleeding or if you can’t stop bleeding, you should go 
to ER and tell what happened to the emergency professionals1. We should call _________ in case of an emergency2. If someone faints, ____________ check his or her pulse. ____________ call 1-1-2 an________ position the person properly3.
