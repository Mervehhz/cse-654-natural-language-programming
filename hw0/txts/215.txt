Surely, everyone is fond of the idea of friendship. In fact, to most people 
living on this earth believe that friends are the most important part of 
their lives. Good friends have many qualities like honesty, thoughtfulness, 
generosity, forgiveness, etc. These features are important but, in my opinion, 
an ideal friend has to be faithful, trustworthy and positive.
