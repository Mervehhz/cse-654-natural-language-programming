Nice to meet you! My name is Mike and I’m sixteen. I live in London with my 
family. We live in a small house. It has three bedrooms and a wonderful gardenI go to a high school. My school is close by so I walk to school every day. My 
favourite subjects are Maths and Science. When I was at primary school, I couldn’t 
solve any math problems. I was really bad at maths but now I am good at Maths. I 
also enjoy playing basketball and I’m in the school basketball team. I couldn’t play 
basketball three years ago. My PE teacher encouraged me to play basketball so 
I become a good basketball player now. Also, I enjoy jogging at the park on 
Saturday mornings. I like taking my dog with me, too. I like watching football 
matches with my father and grandfather on Saturday evenings. My mother 
doesn’t like football so much. She enjoys painting pictures. She can paint very 
well. She could do judo when she was at the university. She can’t do now because 
she had an accident and broke her two legs twenty years ago. My sister is good at 
roller skating. She couldn’t skate very fast last year but she can skate quite fast 
this year. My brother is a bit introvert. He is not social so he isn’t interested 
in group activities. He is keen on computers.

  My name is Hatice. I’m 95 years old and I have experienced 
hard times in my life. When we were young, the conditions 
of living weren’t as comfortable as today. We used to do the 
errands by our hands because there weren’t appliances like 
vacuum cleaners, kitchen robots or things like this. It was 
also very difficult to access the education. There didn’t use to 
be many schools in the neighbourhood or online education 
so we had to walk a long way to reach the school. We used to 
walk to school with the other children in our neighbourhood. 
One day in winter, I was late for school so the other children didn’t wait for me. I 
was going to school alone. It was freezing and there was a heavy snow. While I was 
trying to walk, I slipped and fell down. I wanted to stand up but I couldn’t because 
my leg was broken. There was nobody around and I was crying. After sometime, 
one of our neighbours saw me while I was about frozen to death. He took me to the

a. CHALLENGES OF LIVING IN THE PAST       b. LIFE OF MY GRANDMOTHETechnology and new inventions of the last century have made significanchanges in the way we live. We use technological devices in all parts of our lifeMy grandparents frequently say that how hard their lives used to be. I totallagree with them. There are many things that make living today is much morcomfortable and easierFirst of all, during my grandparents’ time, people used to work much hardebecause they didn’t have such tools which made their work easier. They had to dall the errands by hand. For example, a couple decades ago, people used to wastheir clothes in rivers as they didn’t have running water in many houses or peoplused to use candles at home as there was no electricity at homeSecond, people weren’t able to travel long distances in a short period of time athe planes were used to be rare and very expensive. Most of the people didn’know neither fast cars nor planes. Trips were long, uncomfortable and dangerousFor example, it used to take a couple of days or weeks to go to a place where wcan go in a few hours todayAnother thing is that the entertainment and communication choices used to bvery limited. They could at best listen to the radio, records or the lucky onecould watch black-and-white movie for pleasure. They used to write letters osend telegrams to communicate. There weren’t such devices that we use todayFor instance, when my grandparents were young, there were no mobile phonesThey even had to wait for hours to make an ordinary phone callIn conclusion, people today live in a more comfortable and easier way than in thpast.

I’m a real adrenalin seeker. I love adventure and I go to many places for rock 
climbing, parachute surfing, tracking and sailing. I also like travelling different places 
so I have lots of memories. I’ll tell the strangest one. While I was driving in India a 
few years ago, I found myself in the tiger area. We were in a safari tour with a group. 
I was at the end of the group as we were driving. Suddenly, the car stopped ................................After an hour, the tour guides came and they saved meENGLISH - THEME - HARD TIMEA Piece of CakMany years ago, there was a poor boy whose 
name was Alfred. He was living in a small town. 
He was a very successful student but his family 
couldn’t afford his school expenses so he was 
selling various objects door to door, to pay for 
his school. 
One day again Alfred was selling his goods 
door to door but he was too hungry to walk. He decided to ask for food at the next 
house. He knocked at the door and a young, beautiful girl opened the door. He 
couldn’t ask for food because of his embarrassment. He could just ask for a glass of 
water. The young girl understood his hunger and brought him a big piece of cake 
with a glass of lemonade. The poor boy ate the cake with astonishment. Then, he 
asked ‘How much should I pay for this cake, young lady?’. The girl replied ‘My name 
is Beatrice. I don’t accept anything but I would like to buy a mirror if you have.’ The 
boy showed a silver mirror to the girl. Beatrice liked the mirror very much and 
bought it. 
After many years, Beatrice and her family were having hard times. Her father 
was bankrupted and lost his all money. They were living in difficult conditions 
when the young girl had a serious illness. She was taken to a hospital. Dr Madison, 
a specialist, was called to examine her. When he entered the door, he immediately 
recognized the woman. The doctor examined her and said that she had better have 
an operation immediately. He operated the woman and she overcame her disease in 
a few weeks. Dr Maddison dealt with her personally during that time. 
It was time to leave the hospital and she had to pay 
the bill. With lots of fear, she opened the envelope in 
which there was the bill with no idea how much she 
was charged. Her eyes suddenly filled with tears. It 
was not for that the bill was paid but it was for the 
note written by Dr Alfred Madison – ‘The bill was 
paid with a piece of cake years ago.’
