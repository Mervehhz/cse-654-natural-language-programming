My name is Bartu. I’m sixteen years old and I live in Burdur. I want to talk about my 
future ideas. When I leave school, I think I’ll go to the university and I’ll learn how to cure 
animals because I love animals. My favourite subject is Biology at school and I usually go 
to the Natural History Museum. I’m sure I’ll be a successful vetI hope I’ll get married to a sensitive and a nature lover girl. I think I’ll have two kids and 
live in a small village. I don’t want to be rich or famous but I want to be socially 
beneficial and happyI don’t think that the world will change very much but we all will probably have 
electric cars and very clever robots. I hope we won’t have wars and diseases. I believe life 
will be easier and people will live longer. We’ll take care of nature and animals. 
What about you? What are your plans for the future?

a. Successful entrepreneurs have wealthy families and they are luckyb. Successful entrepreneurs are hard-working, open-minded and determined tsuccessQUALITIES OF A SUCCESSFUL ENTREPRENEUSuccessful business people have many qualities in common with one another. Theare confident and optimistic. They are disciplined self-starters. They are open to 
any new ideas and really hard-working. Lives of some of the most famous successful 
entrepreneurs are really inspirationalWalt Disney started off as a farm boy drawing cartoon pictures of 
his neighbour’s horses for fun. When he was older, Walt tried to get 
a job as a newspaper cartoonist, but he couldn’t find one. He was 
very determined. He created Mickey Mouse which became the 
world’s most famous animation character. Disney was very 
successful with his animation company, but he wasn't satisfied so he 
built the Disneyland Theme Park. Walt was determined to success 
and hardworking. He started with nothing but built a worldrenowne entertainment industry. 
Steve Jobs is one of the most inspirational entrepreneurs. He was 
an adopted child. After starting his technology company in his garage 
with Steve Wozniak, Jobs developed a personal computer. Before 
that, personal computers were very big, unpractical and difficult to 
reach. His first personal computer changed all that. Jobs is known as 
"The Grandfather of the Digital Revolution”. He was creative, 
hardworking and determined to successBill Gates is one of the most famous 
entrepreneurs of our era. At the time when Bill was growing up, 
computers were owned by large companies as they were huge and 
very expensive. There was just one computer at his school. Bill 
found the computer fascinating and he was just 13 when he taught 
himself the computer programming language. While still in high 
school, Bill, with his friend Paul Allen started a firm and earned 
twenty thousand dollars. Gates, then, developed an operating 
system. It was a huge success. 
Bill believed in achieving his goals through hard work. He also believes that if you 
are intelligent and know how to use your intelligence, you can reach your goals and 
targets. From his early days, Bill was ambitious, competitive and intelligent. These 
qualities helped him to attain great position in his professionENGLISH - THEME - FUTURE JOB20. Read the text again. Write true (T) or false (F). (Parçayı tekrar okuyunuzDoğru veya yanlış yazınız.)
