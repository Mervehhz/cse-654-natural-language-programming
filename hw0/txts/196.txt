Read the texts and consider their main points(Parçaları okuyunuz ve ana fikrini bulunuz.)
LET’S READ - R2.AbigaiIn my opinion, one of the most important advantages of social 
media is certainly the speed and efficiency in which it allows 
communication between people. To me, social media has 
given people, especially among the new generation which is 
very computer savvy, a new and an effective instrument to come 
together for issues they believe in. 
On the other hand, some of the disadvantages with being able to 
communicate more easily with multiple people on the Internet is 
the threat, especially for teens and even sometimes young adults, of cyberbullying and 
stalking. Thousands of teens use social media every day, but not all have good intentions. Many 
use a computer screen to hide behind, which makes it easier to make fun of someone, because 
you are not interacting face-to-face. This can seriously damage the individuals who are getting 
bullied and cause them severe stress and painMatI think the biggest advantage of social media is its power to connect 
people. It has become a popular way for family and friends who live 
far away from one another to keep up with what is going on in each 
other’s lives, without the expensive cost of long-distance callingOn the other hand, to me, social media only serves to drive people 
farther away from one another. While it is great that you can contact 
someone in another country, these digital interactions are still a 
poor replacement for face-to-face contact. 
JosephinOne of the greatest advantages of social media is that it allows 
news to travel quickly, across continents and oceans, which 
makes faraway places seem significantly less far away. But at the 
same time the accelerated access to news is also the greatest 
disadvantage of social media because it allows false news to 
spread just as quickly. Social media allows just about anyone to 
create their own misinformed or intentionally skewed content that 
masquerades as news and the ease of access only serves to allow 
the masses to access information that may not be entirely true. I mean, you shouldn’t rely on all the 
news available on the NetMain point: ______________________________________________________________   THEME  TELEVISION AND SOCIAL MEDI2. Write the advantages and disadvantages of social networks according to the texts(Okuduğunuz parçalara göre sosyal medyanın avantajlarını ve dezavantajlarını yazınız.)
