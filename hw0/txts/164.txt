Obsession with the ‘Perfect Figure’: Most girls start starving themselves to get size 0 and boys work out day and night to get those six pack abs but it is not possiblthat every person has the perfect body3.

eating junk or frozen food, watching too much T.V., doing little physical exercise etcThis results in obesity and many diseases4. Parental Pressure: Parents want their children to pursue academic careers. If thewish to do something different (such as Music and Fine Arts), the idea is ridiculedMoreover, there is always a comparison made between the children.

Time management: Scoring well in examinations, holding a job, having a goosocial life etc. makes life tough for youngsters as they face the problem of timmanagement. It is sad that a young person is expected to do so much in a limitetime6. Divorced Parents: Nothing can replace the experience of living in a loving happfamily.

a. The Earth is Dyinb. Save Yourselc. What is Energy ?
The way we’re living, we are already using 2 or 3 times more 
of the Earth’s natural resources. If we do not act now, we will 
see the consequences of depletion of natural resources. A dry 
Earth wouldn't be a fun place to live. Let’s see how our three 
natural resources being depleted and what the causes and the 
consequences are1. WateCauses: Increased irrigation, increased use in agriculture,
roads and infrastructure prevent water seepage in the soil,
rising temperatureConsequences: Water shortage, food shortage2. OiCauses: Industrial boom, increased population, wastageConsequences: Less transportation, higher prices, smalleeconomies3. ForestCauses: Urbanization, illegal logging, agricultureConsequences: Soil erosion, flooding and drought, extinction ospeciesWhat can we do?
There are many simple things you can do to save the planet. Here are some examples:
- Use public transport- Plant a tree- Turn off the lights and appliances when you are not using them- Don’t waste water- Use less electricity- Use recycled materials1. I should waste time in front of the fridge2. I should reduce my water consumption3. I shouldn’t recycle4. I should keep my charged cell phone plugged-in5.

CHINESE NEW YEAWhat is done before the celebration?
What is done on the eve of the celebration?
Interviewer: Have you wondered how Chinese people prepare for the New Year? Let’s 
talk to our Chinese guest about the preparation of the New Year. Welcome, Chow. 
Please, tell us about the New Year. 
Chow:  Thank you. Most of young adults in China work in big cities so they go back 
home to celebrate the New Year with their families. First, before the New Year, Chinese 
families go to the markets to buy a few celebratory items such as upside down “Fu"Interviewer: What's a "Fu"? 
Chow: “Fu" means good fortune, happiness and luck. When the “Fu” is upside down, 
it means that luck and happiness is coming. So many households have this in order to 
bring luck and happiness to their livesInterviewer: Fantastic! 
Chow: We usually hang antithetical couplets over doors. They are two lines of poem 
and families always hang some lanterns on the door front or inside the houseInterviewer: I wish to see one of these houses! And then, what do people do?
Chow: After decorating the houses, people prepare ingredients for New Year’s food. 
Third, the adults prepare red packets.  Red packets are red envelopes with money 
inside. The red packets are given to the young children in the New Year days because 
we believe in China that the money in the red packet will keep children healthy and 
bless them a long life. Finally, people clean their houses to remove the old and welcome 
the newInterviewer: Is there a special celebration on New Year’s Eve?
Chow:  Yes! Firecrackers and fireworks are launched right after 12:00 p.m. on New 
Year’s Eve to celebrate the coming of the New Year. It is the most common celebration 
as it brings in the new year while keeping demons and evil spirits awayInterviewer: Thank you, Chow. I'd like to join a celebration in China8. Read the dialogue again and write the names of the items below the pictures. (Diyaloğtekrar okuyunuz ve resimlerin altına isimlerini yazınız.)

and web feedsThe Internet has enabled or accelerated new forms of  human interactions through instant 
messaging, Internet forums, and social networking. Online shopping has boomed both 
for major retail outlets and small artisans and traders. Business-to-business and financial 
services on the Internet affect supply chains across entire industriesThe origins of the Internet reach back to research of the 1960s, commissioned by the 
United States government in collaboration with private commercial interests to build 
robust, fault-tolerant and distributed computer networks. 1996 is the year when www 
became available for everyone. The most commonly known search engine was born in 
1998. As of 2017, more than 3.8 billion people use the services of the Internet1. The Internet has completely dethroned traditional media2. The Internet has had an impact on commerce3. The Internet was first introduced in the 1990s4. More than a quarter of the Earth's population are the
