Comment__2__A. Martin Faber says:
Regrets are good because we learn from them. You shouldn’t have cheated, but 
the fact that you feel bad means you learned that honesty is the best policy. We all 
do things we regret, and not just when we were young. I’m a quick tempered one. 
Last week, I got very angry with one of my employees as he was late. I yelled at him 
without asking the reason. Then, I learned that his son was very ill. I still feel very 
bad. I wish I hadn’t yelled at him_____B. Pablo Arturo says:
A daring post. It isn’t easy to confess the things like this. You used to have bad 
behaviours when you were in high school. I see that you learned from your regrets. 
Humiliating people is a misbehaviour but you are regretful about this. You can find 
your friends ask for their forgiveness. You can talk to your son’s teachers and I’m 
sure they can handle the problem directly. I have a regret, too. Two years ago, a 
cashier at a big supermarket gave me too much money in change. I recognized later 
but I didn’t care. I returned the money after a week but the cashier had quitted her 
job. I wish I had returned the money immediately. If I had returned the money at 
the time, I would have given the money back. I feel bad!
_____C. Casandra Javier says:
The things you don’t do can also be the source of regret. You are young and you 
can still deal with music. You can learn to play an instrument. Moreover, you don’t 
have to be at high school to travel abroad. You can make opportunities to travel 
abroad. You are not late for these things. Last week I had a job interview but I didn’t 
prepare well. I couldn’t get the job. If I had prepared well, I could have got the job.
