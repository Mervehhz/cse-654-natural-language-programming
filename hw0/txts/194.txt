   THEME  IWORLD HERITAGLET’S REMEMBETalking about past events and situation       The simple past tense is used to talk about a completed action in a time before now. 
The simple past is the basic form of past tense in English. The time of the action can be in 
the recent past or the distant past and action duration is not importantİngilizcede geçmiş zaman geçmişte yaşanmış bitmiş veya belirli bir süre devam etmiş, bitmiş

Olayın ne kadar sürdüğü önemli değildir.  
Geçmiş zaman kullanırken mutlaka kullandığımız fiilin geçmiş zaman halini kullanmak 
zorunda olduğumuzu unutmamamız gerekir. İngilizcede fiillerin geçmiş zaman halleri değişkenlik 
gösterirİngilizcede geçmiş zamanda fiilleri ikiye ayırırıza. Düzenli Fiiller (Regular Verbs)
